---:: Normal map textures for Dissolution of Eternity (MP2) version 1.00 ::---


------ Release note 2016-06-22 ------

Today QRP release our first add-on pack for Quake mission pack 2: 
Dissolution of Eternity (DoE). As the add-on name implies you will also
need to have QRP's Map textures v.1.00 (QRP_map_textures_v.1.00.pk3)
pack installed to get replacement textures for all textures in DoE.

Note that this pack is an addon for our QRP's  DoE Map textures v.1.00
(QRP_DoE_map_textures_add-on_v.1.00.pk3) pack, i.e., it does not work on its own!

------ Included files ------

- QRP_DoE_normal_map_textures_add-on_v.1.00.pk3
- readme_doe_nmtex_add-on_v.1.00.txt (this file!)


------ Installation ------

DarkPlaces client:
- Place the pack (.pk3) in the same directory where your 'QRP_DoE_map_textures_add-on_v.1.00.pk3' resides.
  This folder is usually called 'rogue'and is found inside your Quake directory!

- If you want to turn on parallax mapping, you have to type two commands in quake's console:
  - "r_glsl_offsetmapping 1"
  - "r_glsl_offsetmapping_reliefmapping 1" (this one gives higher quality parallax mapping)

Other Quake clients:
- Consult your client's documentation.
